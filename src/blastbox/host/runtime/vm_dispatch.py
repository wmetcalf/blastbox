"""Libvirt pool job dispatcher — the VM-worker analogue of ``blastbox dispatch``.

``blastbox dispatch`` claims queued jobs and ``docker run``s a fresh worker container per job. A
VM-backed engine can't do that (its worker is a long-lived libvirt VM, not a container), so this is
the parallel: it claims queued jobs from the shared JobStore + their spooled inputs from ``job_root``
and runs each through an engine-supplied ``validate`` callable (which talks the engine's warm VM
worker over its own transport), then writes the verdict back as the Job's ``result_summary``.

It owns ONLY the generic plumbing — the JobStore claim loop (a thread per warm worker), the
CAS-fenced terminal write, and input cleanup. The engine owns the WarmPool + the worker transport
(``validate``). This is the privileged host tier in an ingress/dispatcher split: it is never
client-facing — its inputs are the queue + the spooled files.

    validate(input_path) -> (result_summary: dict | None, ok: bool)
        ok True  -> the job is marked DONE with result_summary
        ok False -> FAILED  (an engine-detected error: dead worker, engine_error envelope, …)
        raising  -> FAILED  (the exception type, sanitized, as the error)

    (not run through the wrong validator). Leave ``None`` for a single-engine store (claim anything).
    ``worker_tier`` is the warm-backend label surfaced to UIs (``worker_runtime`` is always the
    sweep-recognized ``"warm"`` so a peer's crash-recovery treats an in-flight VM job as warm — TIME-
